# Personality-Prediction-model
This project aims to predict an individual's personality traits based on their curriculum vitae (CV) using machine learning techniques. By analyzing the textual content and structure of the CV, the model provides insights into the individual's personality characteristics.

# Data
The model requires a dataset of labeled CVs, where each CV is annotated with the corresponding personality traits. This dataset is used for training and evaluating the model. 

# Model Training 
1. Prepare a dataset of labeled CVs in a suitable format.
2. Preprocess the data by removing noise, punctuation, and stopwords.
3. Extract relevant features from the preprocessed text.
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
5. Train the model using the training data.
6. Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data.
7. Fine-tune the model and experiment with different hyperparameters to improve accuracy.
